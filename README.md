# 🐶 Dog Breed Detector

## Overview
This project uses a pre-trained ResNet50 deep learning model to detect dog breeds from an uploaded image, and checks their endangered status using a custom dataset. A simple GUI built with Tkinter allows users to interact with the model easily.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- TensorFlow / Keras (ResNet50)
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- Pandas (for CSV processing)
- Pillow (for image display)

## Features
- Upload an image and classify dog breed using ResNet50
- Check endangered status from `red_list.csv`
- Highlights results visually in a user-friendly GUI
- Designed as a final-year diploma project with real-world AI application
